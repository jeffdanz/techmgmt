FALLACIES OF DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
----------------------------------
- The network is reliable
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite
- The network is secure
- Topology doesn't change
- There is one administrator
- Transport cost is zero
- The network is homogeneous

LAWS, PRINCIPLES, PHENOMENA AND NUMBERS
---------------------------------------
### Baader Meinhoff
Experiencing something shortly after learning it

### Benford's Law
http://www.rexswain.com/benford.html

### Brooks' Law
Adding manpower to a late project makes it later

### Dunning-Kruger
Dumb people think they're smart, smart people think they're dumb.

### Pareto Principle
80/20 - 80% of effects from 20% of causes

### Peter principle
People are promoted to the level of their incompetence

### Parkinson's Law
Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

### Postel's law
Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you receive

### Conway's law
Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of those organisations

### Waterbed theory
Eliminating something (e.g complexity) in one place requires it to be added somewhere else

### Hawthorne/observer effect
Individuals modify/improve performance in response to being observed.

### Chesterton's fence
Don’t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up

### Kerninghan's Law
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

### Dunbar's number
150\. The limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships—relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.

### 10/10/10 rule [Welch]
When stuck making a decision, ask yourself whether making the wrong decision will matter in **10** minutes, **10** months or **10** years. Prioritise accordingly.

### Gall's law
All complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time.

### Jevons' paradox
Increased efficiency doesn't necessarily lead to reduced consumption as overall demand will increase due to the reduced cost.

### Broken windows theory
Tolerance of minor infractions leads to normalisation, leading to more serious infractions.

### Disagree and commmit
Management principle which states that people are allowed to disagree during the  decision making process, but most commit to the final decision – whatever it is.

PROGRAMMER'S VIRTUES
--------------------
### Laziness
The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy
expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will
find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many
questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. 

### Impatience
The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write
programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or
at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. 

### Hubris
Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that
makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad
things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer.

HYPE CYCLE
----------
### Technology trigger
A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept
stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable
products exist and commercial viability is unproven.

### Peak of inflated expectations
Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by
scores of failures. Some companies take action; many do not.

### Trough of disillusionment
Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of
the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving
providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.

### Slope of enlightenment
More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to
crystallise and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation
products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots;
conservative companies remain cautious.

### Plateau of productivity
Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider
viability are more clearly defined. The technology’s broad market applicability
and relevance are clearly paying off.

STAGES OF GROUP DEVELOPMENT (TUCKMAN)
-------------------------------------
### Forming
Team is built. People want to be accepted by others so little controversy or
conflict.  Administrivia of the team is determined: who does what, when to
meet, etc. People are gathering information and impressions on each other and
the task at hand.

### Storming
Trust has developed so members are more willing to express discontent and
challenge others' opinions. A difficult stage for conflict-adverse members.
Emphasise tolerence and understanding of differences. Team must be a "no
judgement" zone with people free to share views and opinions.

### Norming
Team focuses on its goal. Some members may have to compromise their
ideals for the good of the team but all members take responsibility and have
ambition. People may not want to "rock the boat" by sharing controversial
ideas.

### Performing
Team is highly optimised. Job is done smoothly and effectively
without inappropriate conflict and with little need for supervision. Members
are motivated, knowledgeable, competent, autonomous. Dissent is expected and
healthy as part of the improvement cycle.

SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP THEORY
-----------------------------
## Leadership styles

### S1: Telling
Characterised by one-way communication in which the leader defines the roles of
the individual or group and provides the what, how, why, when and where to do
the task

### S2: Selling
While the leader is still providing the direction, he or she is now using
two-way communication and providing the socio-emotional support that will
allow the individual or group being influenced to buy into the process;

### S3: Participating
This is how shared decision-making about aspects of how the task is
accomplished and the leader is providing less task behaviours while maintaining
high relationship behaviour;

### S4: Delegating
The leader is still involved in decisions; however, the process and
responsibility has been passed to the individual or group. The leader stays
involved to monitor progress.

## Maturity levels

### M1: Unable and insecure
They still lack the specific skills required for the job in hand and are unable
and unwilling to do or to take responsibility for this job or task.

### M2: Unable but willing
They are unable to take on responsibility for the task being done; however,
they are willing to work at the task. They are novice but enthusiastic.

### M3: Capable but unwilling
They are experienced and able to do the task but lack the confidence or the
willingness to take on responsibility.

### M4: Capable and confident
They are experienced at the task, and comfortable with their own ability to do
it well. They are able and willing to not only do the task, but to take
responsibility for the task.


TRAITS OF A GOOD LEADER
-----------------------
### Honest
Display sincerity, integrity, and candor in all your actions. Deceptive
behaviour will not inspire trust.

### Competent
Base your actions on reason and moral principles. Do not make decisions based
on childlike emotional desires or feelings.

### Forward-looking
Set goals and have a vision of the future. The vision must be owned throughout
the organisation. Effective leaders envision what they want and how to get it.
They habitually pick priorities stemming from their basic values.

### Inspiring
Display confidence in all that you do. By showing endurance in mental,
physical, and spiritual stamina, you will inspire others to reach for new
heights. Take charge when necessary.

### Intelligent
Read, study, and seek challenging assignments.

### Fair-minded
Show fair treatment to all people. Prejudice is the enemy of justice. Display
empathy by being sensitive to the feelings, values, interests, and well-being
of others.

### Broad-minded
Seek out diversity.

### Courageous
Have the perseverance to accomplish a goal, regardless of the seemingly
insurmountable obstacles. Display a confident calmness when under stress.

### Straightforward
Use sound judgment to make a good decisions at the right time.

### Imaginative
Make timely and appropriate changes in your thinking, plans, and methods. Show
creativity by thinking of new and better goals, ideas, and solutions to
problems. Be innovative!

3 STAGES OF ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------
### Stage I: Chaos (fire-fighting mentality)
- Crisis/short-term focus
- Lack of clear direction and goals
- Shifting priorities
- Unclear policies and procedures
- “Us” vs. “them” attitude
- Blame and lack of ownership
- Alienated work force

### Stage II: Stability (back to the basics)
- Clarity of goals and direction
- Consistency in priorities
- Well-defined policies and procedures (technical and personnel)
- Agreement on roles and responsibilities
- Basic management processes rewarded and practiced (goal-setting, performance reviews, etc.)

### Stage III: High performance (outstanding, sustainable results)
* Clear statement of mission that creates sense of esprit de corp.
* Well defined values which result in distinctive culture
* Respect for people that is a deeply ingrained part of culture
* Good communication and information sharing systems
* High involvement and empowerment of people
* Design (work flow, structure, systems) that supports mission and values

THEORY OF ORGANISATIONAL SAFETY (WESTRUM)
-----------------------------------------
### Pathological
- Information is hidden
- Messengers are shot
- Responsibilities are shirked
- Bridging is discouraged
- Failure is covered up
- New ideas are actively crushed

### Bureaucratic
- Information may be ignored
- Messengers are tolerated
- Responsibility is compartmentalised
- Bridging is allowed by neglected
- Organisation is just and merciful
- New ideas create problems

### Generative
- Information is actively sought
- Messengers are trained
- Responsibilities are shared
- Bridging is rewarded
- Failure causes inquiry
- New ideas are welcomed

INVEST (User stories)
---------------------
- Independent: The user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story.
- Negotiable:  User stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten.
- Valuable:    A user story must deliver value to the end user.
- Estimable:   You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
- Scalable:    User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of certainty.
- Testable:    The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.


TWO-FACTOR THEORY (HERZBERG)
----------------------------
### Motivators (satisfaction)
Challenging work, recognition, responsibility

### Hygiene factors (dissatisfaction)
Status, job security, salary, benefits, work conditions

- High motivation + high hygiene: The ideal. Employees motivated with few complaints
- High motivation + low hygiene: Employees motivated but have many complaints. Work is exciting and challenging but salaries and conditions are poor
- Low motivation + high hygiene: Employees have few complaints but work isn't exciting. Job seen as a paycheque.
Low motivation + low hygiene: The worst. Employees not motivated and have many complaints.

LAW OF DEMETER
--------------
- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
- Only talk to your immediate friends.

THE FIVE DYSFUNCTIONS OF A TEAM
-------------------------------
### Dysfunction #1: Absence of Trust
The fear of being vulnerable with team members prevents the building of trust within the team.

### Dysfunction #2: Fear of Conflict
The desire to preserve artificial harmony stifles the occurrence of productive ideological conflict.

### Dysfunction #3: Lack of Commitment
The lack of clarity or buy-in prevents team members from making decisions they will stick to.

### Dysfunction #4: Avoidance of Accountability
The need to avoid interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding one another accountable.

### Dysfunction #5: Inattention to Results
The pursuit of individual goals and personal status erodes the focus on collective success.

ACCELERATE METRICS
------------------
Metrics to measure team performance, taken from _Accelerate_ by Forsgren, Kim, Humble.

- **Cycle time**: Average time for a commit to make it to production
- **Deployment frequency**: How frequently updates are made in production
- **MTTR**: Average time to recover from failure
- **Failed deploy %**: How many changes fail

PIONEERS, SETTLERS, TOWN PLANNERS (WARDLEY)
-------------------------------------------
Wardley posits that people fall into three broad categories – all brilliant and necessary.

### Pioneers
Come up with new and novel ideas. Risk-takers, lots of uncertainty, experimental. High degree of failure, but learning from it. "Move fast and break things". Inventors.

Produces prototypes.

### Settlers
Takes prototypes and commercialises them. Builds trust and understanding. Makes it repeatable, reliable, profitable. Innovators.

Produces products.

### Town planners
Takes products and industrialises them. Makes things faster, better, smaller, more efficient, more economic and more profitable. Diffusers.

Produces services, utilities and commodities (used by the next generation of pioneers)

20-60-20 RULE FOR CHANGE (NAPIER)
---------------------------------
Napier posits that reaction to change will broadly fall into three main camps.

### 20% Positive
See the benefit of the change and are on board from the start. Supportive cheerleaders.

### 60% Neutral/Undecided
'Silent majority' who are unsure, but can be convinced with data/evidence.

### 20% Negative
'Vocal minority' who resist the change from the start, either because the change will affect them directly or because change is intrinsically bad. Possibly former "positives" who have been worn down into cynical pessimists.

#### Summary
The temptation is often to focus on the 'vocal minority', however the cost/benefit calculus doesn't make sense – they're very difficult (or even impossible) to win over at great cost.

Instead pay attention to the silent majority. Work out what they need to be convinced and deliver it to them. At that point you'll have 80% and the negative 20% will be forced to 'disagree and commit' or get out of the way.

CALMS
-----
Principles popularised by the the 
movement.

### Culture
Embrace change and share responsibility. Operate a safe, blameless environment where people have room to fail and to grow

### Automation
Automate where possible. Let people focus on the novel, computers on the repetitive. Operate continuous integegration (CI) and ideally continuous delivery (CD). Bias towards maintaining configuration as code wherever possible

### Lean
Continually deliver value in small batches

### Measurement
You can't fix what you don't measure. Measure and adjust

### Sharing
Maintain transparent communication channels within the team and beyond

LAWS OF ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR (LARMAN)
-----------------------------------------
At large scale culture is born out of structure. If you want to change culture, you need to start with the structure.

1. Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo middle- and first-level manager and “specialist” positions & power structures

1. As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the new terminology to mean basically the same as status quo.

1. As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be derided as “purist”, “theoretical”, “revolutionary”, "religion", and “needing pragmatic customization for local concerns” — which deflects from addressing weaknesses and manager/specialist status quo.

1. As a corollary to (1), if after changing the change some managers and single-specialists are still displaced, they become “coaches/trainers” for the change, frequently reinforcing (2) and (3).

1. Culture follows structure.

STRATEGIC THINKERS AND RESEARCHERS
-----------------------------------------
Ansoff, Igor
- Wrote Corporate Strategy to “codify and generalize” his work at Lockheed Corporation.
- Created “Ansoff Model of Strategic Planning” which identifies a decision making process from aggregated to more specific.  The procedure is a cascade where
          - Set objectives established
          - Gap of current position vs.  objectives is estimated
          - One or more strategy are proposed
          - Strategies are tested for “gap-reducing properties”
- Created the word “synergy”
- Precursor to “corporate advantage”
- Corporate Strategy relies heavily on analysis, thus Ansoff labels “analysis by paralysis”

Argyris & Schon
- Organizational Learning (1978)
- Precursor to Senge’s Fifth Discipline
- Investigate 2-organizational models:
          - Model  1 
                    - Manipulation by managers
                    - Goal focused
                    - “Cone of silence”, head down and do the work, do not ask questions
                    - Considered Single-Loop Learning
          - Model 2
                    - Emphasis on “Double Loop Learning”
                    - When an error is detected, orgs debate solution, act on change, learn from others
                    - Most orgs do well in Single Loop Learning, but struggle with Double

Bartlett & Ghoshal
- Managing Across Borders (1989)
- Identify difficulties in growth through acquisition and dangerously high levels of diversity
- 4 Types of multi-national firms
          - Multi-National - Multi-domestic, power in local responsiveness
          - Global – efficiencies of scale, cost advantages
          - International – ability to transfer knowledge and expertise overseas
          - Transnational – combines local responsiveness w/ ability to xfer knowledge
- Define Emerging Organizational Model
          - Entrepreneurial Process – drive external opportunity seeking for new business
          - Integration Process – Allows link to leverage dispersed resources and competencies
          - Renewal Process – maintains corporate values and practices

Bennis & Nanus
- Leaders: The Strategies for Taking Charge (1985)
- Bennis interviews 90 American leaders
- Lessons
          - Management of Attention:  Vision, shared with team members
          - Management of Meaning:  Communication, incl. choosing the right forum (memo, email, booklet, press release, face-to-face meeting)
          - Management of Trust:  The glue that binds…must have with team, common to all leaders
- Worst problem  in leadership is early success, no chance to learn from adversity and problems
- 5 myths of leadership need to be overcome.  Should be understood that:
          - Leadership is not a rare skill
          - Leaders are made rather than born
          - Leaders are mostly ordinary people
          - Leadership is not solely the reserve of upper management
          - Leadership is not about control, direction, and manipulation

Champy & Hammer
- Re-engineering the Corporation (1993)
- Theme: Identify key processes and make them lean and efficient as possible
- Re-engineering is “fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical measures of performance such as cost,           quality, service, and speed.”
- Business Process Re-engineering is too limiting, we must stop paving the cow paths
- Criticisms
          - Mintzberg (1996) disagrees with the concept of reengineering.  It’s just same old notion that a new system will solve the problem. 
          - Reengineering has become synonymous w/ redundancy
          - CSC’s report The State of Reingineering (1994) found that 336 US jobs and 760 Europe jobs were lost per reengineering project.
          - Organizations are not willing to change by nature, mgmt often forces change, but does not adopt change itself.
          - Efforts fall short b/c absence of trust “respect for the individual, his or her goodwill, intelligence, and native, but long shackled, curiosity.” (Peters, 1993)

Chandler
- Strategy and Structure (1962)
- Researched US companies between 1850 – 1920
- A firms structure is dictated by its chosen strategy; “Unless a structure follows strategy, inefficiency results”
- Criticism
          - Thesis that “structure follows strategy” was largely accepted until the 1990’s.  
          - “I think he got it exactly wrong.  For it is the structure of the organization that determines, over time, the choices that it makes about the markets it attacks.”               (Peters, 1992)
          - In Managing on the Edge (Pascale, 1990)

Deming
- Out of the Crisis (1982)
- Three concepts in Out of the Crisis:
          - If consistent quality is to be achieved, senior managers must take charge of quality
          - Implementation takes a cascade training model from the top down.
          - Use statistical methods for QC is necessary
- “Management for Quality” (Deming)
- To Deming, management accounts for 90% of the problem
- Western mgrs have annual appraisals, Japanese have daily feedback
- 14-Points on quality management

Drucker
- Predicted the rise of the Corporation
- Age of Discontinuity (1969), describes “Knowledge Worker”
- Calls for strategic planning to manage change
- Entrepreneurship offers a way to manage change
- Marketing concept
          - Consumer sovereignty
          - Look at business from customer’s perspective
          - Consumer Rationality
          - Utility function
- How customers use and benefit from product
          - Distinction between sales and marketing
          - Systems Approach
          - Demand Faction
          - Ask two questions: What will the business be, what should the business be?
- Role of executive is to:
          - Sharpen corporate vision
          - Generate improved performance
          - Become increasingly effective thru learning and practice

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY
-----------------------------------------
- Cognitive: mental skills (Knowledge) 
- Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude) 
- Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (Skills) 

PSYCHMOTOR DOMAINS
-----------------------------------------
Dave's
- Imitation: Observing and patterning behavior after someone else. Performance may be of low quality. Example: Copying a work of art. 
- Manipulation: Being able to perform certain actions by following instructions and practicing. Example: Creating work on one's own, after taking lessons, or reading about it. 
- Precision: Refining, becoming more exact. Few errors are apparent. Example: Working and reworking something, so it will be "just right." 
- Articulation: Coordinating a series of actions, achieving harmony and internal consistency. Example: Producing a video that involves music, drama, color, sound, etc. 
- Naturalization: Having high level performance become natural, without needing to think much about it. Examples: Michael Jordan playing basketball, Nancy Lopez hitting a golf    ball, etc. 

Harrow's
- Reflex movements - Reactions that are not learned. 
- Fundamental movements - Basic movements such as walking, or grasping. 
- Perception - Response to stimuli such as visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or tactile discrimination. 
- Physical abilities - Stamina that must be developed for further development such as strength and agility. 
- Skilled movements - Advanced learned movements as one would find in sports or acting. 
- No discursive communication - Effective body language, such as gestures and facial expressions. 

STUDY TECHNIQUES FOR COMPREHENSIVE EXAMS AND THE DEFENDING THE DOCTORAL DISSERTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below are some techniques I personally used and created to help me recall, apply, demonstrate knowledge, familiarity, and application of research/concepts/technique.

-Take SAFMEDS daily 
          - From Dr. Ogden Lindsley, University of Kansas. 
          - He named this system of cards, SAFMEDS ("Say All Fast, a Minute Each Day, Shuffled"). 

- Practice Makes Perfect
          - It’s boring, but it works
          - Write answers to sample questions.  
          - Time your responses.
          - Rinse and repeat.

- Now Appearing on Center Stage!
          - I made up folks songs about the topics and authors to help me remember
          - Southern people are known for silly folk songs and singing while they work.  My grandmother's homespun songs inspired this one.
          - I would make up little ditties about the authors I was studying and stories about their research.
          - I play the guitar with no meaningful direction or skill.  I would strum songs about all these authors with dates and stories.  
          - For example:  "Champy & Hammer fought for radical redesign of corporate processes or bust!  Then Mintzberg shut them down in 1996 and Tom Peters had no trust."

- Join the Technology Management All-Stars
          - I created my all star team of technology management professionals.  
          - Depending on the question, I would substitute in my specialists to complete the question.
          - Researcher All-Stars: Minium, Noursis, Hayden, Beach, NSF 
          - General management All-Stars: Drucker, Chandler, Champy & Hammer, Demming, Bennis & Nanus, Argyris & Shon
          - Technical Specialist All-Stars (Dig Comm) – Burgess, Willyard & McCleese, Khalil, Garcia-Arreola, etc.
          
- Synthesize information
          - I would listen to NPR or a podcast from prominent management thinkers and add to the segment.  
          - For example, I read an article in the WSJ by Gary Hamel.  I identified a number of critical sources that differ from Hamel’s opinion.
          - I learned about a group called Architecture2030 and how they take an efficient approach to technology in buildings.  I compared some of their obstacles with those                of digital communications systems: repurposing resources, informal systems, legacy assets, etc.
          - This demonstrates critical thinking and the ability to synthesis current and historical information into a meaningful format.


KELLY'S 14 RULES
-----------------------------------------
Kelly Johnson, legendary visioniory aviation leader of the fabled Lockheed Martin Skunkworks

1.  The Skunk Works' program manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher.
2.  Strong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry.
3.  The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10 percent to 25 percent compared to the so-called normal systems).
4.  A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided.
5.  There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.
6.  There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program. Don't have the books ninety days late and don't surprise the customer with sudden overruns.
7.  The contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones.
8.  The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and the Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to the subcontractors and vendors. Don't duplicate so much inspection.
9.  The contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles.
10.  The specification applying to the hardware must be agreed to in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons therefore is highly recommended.
11.  Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to support government projects.
12.  There must be absolute mutual trust between the military organization and the contractor with very close liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum.
13.  Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures.
14.  Because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay, not simply related to the number of personnel supervised.
